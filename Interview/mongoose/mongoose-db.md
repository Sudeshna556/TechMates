# what to learn in mongoose :

- schemas
- models
- connections
- schema types
- CRUD Operations: Performing the essential database functions: Create, Read (find), Update, and Delete data using Mongoose models and queries. 

Advance topics:

- Queries: Learning the powerful query building interface Mongoose provides, including methods like find(), findOne(), findByIdAndUpdate(), and query helpers.

- Validation: Implementing built-in or custom validation logic to ensure data integrity before saving documents to the database.

- Middleware (Hooks): Utilizing pre and post hooks for schemas to execute logic automatically at specific stages of operations (e.g., before saving a document, after a query is executed).

- Aggregation: Understanding how to perform complex data analysis and transformations using Mongoose aggregation pipelines.

- Indexing: Implementing indexes to optimize query performance and ensure data consistency.
- Transactions: Learning how to perform atomic operations that affect multiple documents or collections, ensuring data consistency.
