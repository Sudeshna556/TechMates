What is a web service?
A web service is a standardized way for two applications to communicate over the internet, typically using protocols like HTTP and data formats such as XML or JSON. It allows software systems written in different languages or running on different platforms to exchange information seamlessly.

or we can say that a web service is essentially a bridge that lets different applications talk to each other over the internet using standardized protocols and formats.

Web Service in Detail
- Software Module: A self-contained piece of software that performs specific tasks (e.g., retrieving user data, processing payments).
- Available Over the Internet: Accessible via standard web protocols like HTTP or HTTPS.
- Exposes Functionality/Data: Provides an interface (API) so other applications can request operations or information.

Types of Web Services
- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol): XML-based, highly structured, often used in enterprise systems.
- REST (Representational State Transfer): Lightweight, uses HTTP methods, often returns JSON, widely used in modern APIs.
- RPC (Remote Procedure Call): Invokes methods on remote servers, using XML-RPC or JSON-RPC.
